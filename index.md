# About Me

Hi, I'm Ashar! ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a software engineer with a passion for building useful, scalable technology.  
Right now, I'm exploring how to position myself into a proper tech role while also keeping an eye on entrepreneurship opportunities.  

I enjoy:  
- Solving real-world problems with code  
- Learning new frameworks and tools  
- Brainstorming ideas that could grow into startups  

When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll probably find me:  
- Reading about tech trends  
- Working on side projects  
- Connecting with people who share a love for innovation  

Feel free to reach out if you'd like to chat about software, startups, or anything in between.
