## Projects
I'm passionate about building tools that solve real-world problems. Below are a few projects I've worked on. Many more of my smaller experiments and contributions can be found on my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/asharmalik19).

### [Google News Summarizer](https://github.com/asharmalik19/g_news_summarization)
An app that scrapes and displays summaries from Google News to provide quick insights into the latest headlines by generating AI summaries.

### [Bizsleuth](https://apify.com/ashar_malik/lead-hunter)
A lead generation tool that scrapes all essential information about a business from its website for outreach. It uses AI for parsing information.


## Open Source Contributions
I love to contribute to Open Source projects in my free time. Below you can find some of my contributions along with the links to the PRs

- [Pandas](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/) &mdash; The `NA` values were dropped when a particular data type was involved even when the user had explicitly specified not to drop them. [PR #60777](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/pull/60777)
- [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/) &mdash; The meta refresh redirect was not working as expected. It was completely ignoring the base URL in the `<base>` HTML tag while resolving the redirect URL for the relative URL in the `<meta>` tag. [PR #7047](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy/pull/7047)
